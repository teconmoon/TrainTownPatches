# 3D Ultra Lionel TrainTown Patches
This repo is a collection of BPS Patches for 3D Ultra Lionel TrainTown, both the original game and the Deluxe version. This includes version patches and NoCD patches for the Deluxe versions. These patches can be applied using [this web patcher by Marc Robledo](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/).

I uploaded these BPS files because the official update for the original game utilizes a 16-bit installer which is a pain to run on modern Windows. This isn't a problem for the deluxe update, but then I couldn't find a NoCD patch for the Deluxe Version 2.01 anywhere online, so I decided to make a repo with everything in one place. The official versions of these patches originally came from [The Sierra Help Pages](http://www.sierrahelp.com/Patches-Updates/Patches-Updates-Games/3-DUltraSeriesUpdates.html).

### Recommended Patches:
- For the Original 1999 release, use **TRAIN_10_to_11.bps**. This updates TRAIN.exe from v1.0 to v1.1 (Official).
- For the Deluxe 2000 release, use **TrainDlx_200_to_201_NoCD.bps**. This updates TrainDlx.exe v2.00 to v2.01 and adds the NoCD Patch (Unofficial).
